# Zoho_Bash_Api
This is a call to Zoho Api to read and write. In this repo I have just written some codes in Bash to fetch JSON response for milestones, tasklist and of course the related tasks to them. You need to generate your refresh token, Client ID and Client Secret on your own following the Zoho API guide.
